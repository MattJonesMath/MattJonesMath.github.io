My name is Matt Jones. I am a mathematician who uses network science, game theory, probability theory, and more to study complex systems, particularly social dynamics.

Research
======
I am a mathematician who uses network science, game theory, probability theory, and more to study complex systems, particularly social dynamics.

I earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Dartmouth College under Feng Fu. My thesis is titled "Evolutionary Dynamics of Collective Action Problems." Currently, I am a postdoc at Yale University working with Nicholas Christakis in the Yale Institue for Network Science and the Human Nature Lab.

Teaching
======
I have a deep love and passion for teaching. 

As a graduate student, I taught classes on calculus, linear algebra, and mathematical models of social systems.
