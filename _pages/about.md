My name is Matt. I use math to study complex systems, particularly group dynamics.

I earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Dartmouth College under [Feng Fu](https://mhl.host.dartmouth.edu/) for my thesis titled, "Evolutionary Dynamics of Collective Action Problems." From 2022 to 2024, I was a postdoctoral associate at Yale University working with Nicholas Christakis in the Yale Institute for Network Science and the Human Nature Lab. Now, I am a Visiting Assistant Professor at the College of the Holy Cross.
