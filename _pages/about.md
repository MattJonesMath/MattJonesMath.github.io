My name is Matt. I use math to learn new things about real systems.

I earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Dartmouth College under Feng Fu. My thesis is titled "Evolutionary Dynamics of Collective Action Problems." Currently, I am a postdoc at Yale University working with Nicholas Christakis in the Yale Institue for Network Science and the Human Nature Lab.
