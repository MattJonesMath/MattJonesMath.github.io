My name is Matt. I use math to study complex systems, particularly group dynamics.

I earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Dartmouth College under [Feng Fu](https://mhl.host.dartmouth.edu/) for my thesis titled "Evolutionary Dynamics of Collective Action Problems." Currently, I am a postdoc at Yale University working with Nicholas Christakis in the Yale Institue for Network Science and the Human Nature Lab.
