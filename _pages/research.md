**Research Interests**

My research interests are broad and interdisciplinary, but they center around using mathematical ideas from network science, game theory, probability, and game theory to build and analyze models of complex systems. To me, mathematics is a set of powerful tools to better understand the increasingly complex world around us. New modes of group behavior continue to emerge in our society, and my research involves using a powerful combination of mathematical analysis, computation, and data to not only understand how these complex social systems function, but how they can be changed to bring about a better world.
